A comprehensive protocol for clustering classification
This thesis examines the improvements in clustering visualization due to the use of
dimensionality reduction techniques as a pre processing step. The evaluation of the results
is conducted by employing appropriate validation metrics.
This project is grounded on a study carried out by professor Salini (University of Milan),
Gran  ÃÅe (University Carlos III of Madrid) and Riani (University of Parma) in which evi-
dence of the improvement of the clustering visualization were discovered. By integrating
the process from that paper and by supplementing them with additional dimensionality
reduction techniques and clustering methods, the aim was to evaluate their effectiveness
across various benchmark and sampled datasets, followed by a subsequent application on
real life data.
The dimensionality reduction techniques that have been employed are: PCA, MDS, t-SNE
and UMAP while instead the utilized clustering methods are: k-means, tkmeans, tclust,
mclust and PAM.
Across all the examined cases remarkable improvements thanks to the use of dimensionality
reduction were observed in the silhouette score, connectivity and clustering visualization.
PCA and MDS showed improvements, particularly in case were there was correlation, but
the results were not as good as the one obtained with t-SNE and UMAP, in particular for
what concerns the clustering visualization.
